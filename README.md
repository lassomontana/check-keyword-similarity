# check-keyword-similarity
This project is designed to process a list of keywords, calculate their semantic similarity using TF-IDF vectorisation and cosine similarity to avoid duplicate keywords and duplicate pages

#The primary steps include:

# 1 Reading an Excel file containing the keywords.
# 2 Calculating the similarity between keywords.
# 3 Adding columns to show the most similar keywords and their scores.
# 4 Applying conditional formatting to highlight high similarity scores in the Excel file.
